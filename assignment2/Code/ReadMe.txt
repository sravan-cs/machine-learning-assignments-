How to run Regression Code:
1)First Change address of input files of Training data
and Development data in lines 207 and 208 for 1D data and
254 and 255 in 2D data
2)If you want to run on 1D data for different values of N,
degree and lambda, add Them to lists in line 232, 242 and 245
3)If you want to do the same for 2D data, add different values of
N to line 273,283,286.
Run the program.
4)Different folders will be created with corresponding
graph images.Folder N100 means for N = 100, folder D8
means Degree = 8
5)RMS error values for different parameters are printed in
RMSVALUES.txt and RMSVALUES2D.txt in the format:
N Degree Lambda ETrainRMS EDevRMS
How to run Classifier Code:
1)Change the address of Train and Input data in line 8 and line 9
2)Run the program.
3)Different graphs with self explainatory names are created in the same folder.
